ü•á Tier 1: High-impact / Most frequently flagged features
1. Low Perplexity

"The sun rises in the east and sets in the west."

Predictable, statistically simple language across many tokens.

Why it happens: AI chooses high-probability tokens to sound coherent.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "Despite the dawn‚Äôs routine path, it always felt new to her."

2. Uniform Sentence Length (Low Burstiness)

"He ran. He ate. He slept. He worked."

Repeated sentence rhythm, little variation in length.

Why it happens: AI aims for consistency and simplicity.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "After a frantic sprint, he collapsed into his chair, exhausted."

3. N-gram Repetition / Repeated Phrases

"It is important to note that... It is important to note that..."

Identical phrase reused in multiple parts.

Why it happens: AI relies on templates and pattern completion.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "Keep in mind that... Also worth considering is..."

4. Lack of Specific or Personal Details

"Some people enjoy art. It can be very meaningful."

Generic, detached tone with no names, anecdotes, or specifics.

Why it happens: AI avoids unverifiable or personal claims.

ü•à Tier 2: Strong signals, but context-dependent
6. Overuse of Formal Transitions

"Furthermore, it is essential to understand... Moreover, we must..."

Overly formal flow connectors.

Why it happens: AI draws from academic/encyclopedic training data.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "Also, here's why that matters..."

7. Too-Perfect Grammar & Zero Typos

"There are no errors in this document."

Unnaturally clean text, no spelling slips or punctuation quirks.

Why it happens: AI grammar correction is automatic.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "I wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôd work‚Äîbut hey, worth a shot."

8. Overuse of Rare Words or Synonyms

"He endeavored to ameliorate the situation despite the cacophony."

Emotionless, detached summaries of potentially emotional topics.

Why it happens: AI avoids personal judgments unless prompted.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "I cried when it ended. Didn‚Äôt expect to, but I did."

ü•â Tier 3: Subtle patterns / Often combined with others
11. Simplified Syntax / Repetitive Structure

"He saw the bird. He took a photo. He walked away."

Little sentence variation, no subordinate clauses.

Why it happens: AI simplifies grammar to reduce hallucinations.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "After spotting the bird, he snapped a photo and kept walking."

12. Logical Inconsistencies / Topic Jumps

"Tom studies history. Also, AI is changing finance. Therefore, conclusions can be drawn."

Abrupt or illogical transitions.

Why it happens: AI struggles with long-form coherence.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "While Tom studies history, his focus includes the economic effects of AI."

13. Adjective or Adverb Stacking

"The really very extremely beautiful sunny yellow day..."

Stacked descriptors without natural flow.

Why it happens: AI inflates description to be ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù

Characters and scenarios feel fake or lifeless.

Why it happens: AI fills in placeholders with clich√©s.

üîç BONUS: Invisible or detector-only markers
18. Semantic Embedding Proximity

"This text embeds near GPT-style outputs." (Not visible)

Measured in vector space, it looks like typical AI content.

Why it happens: Word choices and structure match AI-generated clusters.

"example fixed" ‚Äì Include uncommon topics, style shifts, or lived experiences.

19. Token Bias / Watermarking (GPT-4 specific)

"Invisible token patterns detected." (Not user-visible)

Tokens follow slightly unnatural frequency patterns.

Why it happens: Some LLMs embed watermarking for detection.

"example fixed" ‚Äì Manual rewrite with original sentence structures.

20. Overlap With Known AI Content

"In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, technology is evolving rapidly..."

Matches high-frequency AI-generated opening lines.

Why it happens: AI reuses popular text from training corpora.

"example fixed" ‚Äì "Half the apps on your phone didn‚Äôt exist five years ago. That‚Äôs wild."
