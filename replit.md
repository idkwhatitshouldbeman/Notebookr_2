# Notebookr - AI-Powered Engineering Notebooks

## Overview
Notebookr is a free, AI-powered engineering notebook application designed to help engineers write technical documentation through a conversational interface. Users interact with an AI to generate all notebook content. The application features a standalone authentication system and utilizes free OpenRouter AI models with OpenAI as a fallback for content generation. Its ambition is to streamline technical writing, making it accessible and efficient for engineers.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (October 23, 2025)
- **Aggressive Clarifying Questions System:** Planning now uses 4 clear pattern-matching checkpoints (FORMAT, LENGTH, SCOPE, AUDIENCE) to decide whether to ask clarifying questions. If ANY checkpoint missing from user prompt ‚Üí ask questions. If ALL present ‚Üí proceed to execution. Replaces previous vague "evaluate if detailed enough" approach.
- **Safety Guards for Missing Tasks:** Added null checks for `plan.tasks` array with fallback task generation from `requiredSections` or default task. Prevents crashes during execution phase.
- **Enhanced Question Handling:** If AI sets `hasQuestions=true` but provides no questions array, system uses default questions (format, length, focus, audience). Prevents edge case where user gets no questions.
- **Improved Awaiting Answers:** When user answers questions, prompt now explicitly requires AI to generate `requiredSections` and `tasks` arrays before proceeding to execution.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Added detailed logs throughout planning process for debugging question-asking behavior and task generation.

## Previous Changes (October 20, 2025)
- **Green Completion Messages:** Section completion messages now show as "‚úÖ Finished making: [Section]" with expandable content. Messages persist in database and load on page reload. Chat only shows summary - actual content visible via click to expand.
- **Fixed Chapter Counter:** Shows completed chapters/total (e.g., 8/12) instead of task progress. Counts chapters with >500 chars as complete.
- **Colored Status Indicators:** Each chapter displays status dot: üî¥ red (<100 chars), üü° yellow (100-500 chars), üü¢ green (>500 chars).
- **Removed Iteration Limit:** AI runs indefinitely until marking work complete, with early exit when all sections are green (>500 chars).
- **Responsive Chapter Panel:** Expands on larger screens: base 320px (w-80), lg 384px, xl 448px, 2xl 512px.
- **Specific Task Messages:** Shows "‚úçÔ∏è Writing [Section]... (X/Y completed)" instead of generic "Executing tasks...".
- **Detailed Timing Logs:** Each API request duration displayed in chat (e.g., "‚è±Ô∏è API request completed in 5.23s") and persisted to database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Design System:** Custom color palette (warm beige/dark), Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, comprehensive component library, theme switching, and responsive design.
- **Key Features:** Standalone username/password authentication, chat-based AI content generation, conversational AI context understanding, notebook management (create, rename, delete, emoji support), chapters navigation, template system for document types, real-time content updates, and secure user-scoped data access.
- **UI/UX Decisions:** Full-screen document view, real-time chat progress updates (planning, executing, reviewing, post-processing phases), visual feedback for section updates (flashing animation), dynamic variables accordion, smart progress indicators, live section completion updates, and enhanced visual separation in expanded view.

### Backend Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), connect-pg-simple for session management, and OpenAI API integration.
- **API Design:** RESTful API, secure authentication endpoints (register, login, logout), protected notebook and section endpoints, AI generation endpoint, Zod for request validation, and user ownership validation.
- **Data Models:** PostgreSQL database storing Users, Sessions, Notebooks (including `aiMemory` for AI context), Sections, Section Versions (for history), and Messages (chat history with role and content). All sensitive data, like password hashes, are sanitized from API responses.
- **Development Approach:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, standalone authentication with scrypt hashing, PostgreSQL session storage, hot module replacement, custom logging, and error handling middleware.

### AI System
- **Four-Phase AI Workflow:** Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Post-Process.
    - **Planning:** Uses 4-checkpoint pattern matching (FORMAT, LENGTH, SCOPE, AUDIENCE) to evaluate user instructions. If all checkpoints present ‚Üí proceed to execution. If any missing ‚Üí ask clarifying questions. Extracts variables (topic, length, tone, criteria) and creates document plan with tasks and required sections.
    - **Execution:** Processes one task per call, generating/updating sections. Safety guards ensure tasks array always exists, with fallback generation from requiredSections.
    - **Review:** Evaluates content quality and completeness.
    - **Post-Process:** Transparently checks and fixes content to avoid AI detection patterns, enhancing human-like qualities.
- **AI Memory System:** `notebook.aiMemory` stores TODO lists and document plans for persistent context.
- **AI Detection Avoidance:** Post-processing phase specifically targets and mitigates AI detection patterns.
- **Version History:** Automatic snapshots of sections before updates with restore functionality.
- **Question Handling:** Default questions provided if AI fails to generate questions. Awaiting answers phase regenerates full plan with tasks and sections.
