# Notebookr - AI-Powered Engineering Notebooks

## Overview

Notebookr is a free AI-powered engineering notebook application that uses a conversational interface to help engineers write technical documentation. Users chat with AI, and it writes all the notebook content for them. The application features Replit Auth for secure user authentication and uses Replit AI Integrations for free AI content generation (billed to Replit credits, no API key needed).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (October 16, 2025)

- Added userId foreign key to notebooks for user ownership
- Added aiMemory (jsonb) and documentType fields to notebooks for AI context
- Added section_versions table for version history (sectionId, content, createdAt)
- All routes now enforce user-scoped data access for security

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing:** Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Library:** Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens following Material Design 3 / Fluent Design hybrid approach

**Design System:**
- Custom color palette with warm beige theme for light mode and warm dark for dark mode
- Typography using Inter for UI/content and JetBrains Mono for code
- Comprehensive component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Theme switching capability with persistent user preferences
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Key Features:**
- User authentication with standalone username/password system
- Secure password hashing and session management
- Chat-based interface where AI writes all notebook content
- Conversational AI understands context and updates appropriate sections
- Notebook creation and management with emoji support
- Chapters navigation panel for viewing AI-generated content
- Template system for common engineering document types (Lab Reports, Design Documents, Project Logs, etc.)
- Real-time content updates with automatic cache invalidation
- Secure user-scoped data access with ownership validation

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language:** TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Session Management:** connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for content generation

**API Design:**
- RESTful API structure with resource-based endpoints
- Authentication endpoints: POST /api/register, POST /api/login, POST /api/logout, GET /api/user
- Password hashing using scrypt before storage
- User responses sanitized to exclude password hashes
- Notebooks endpoints (protected): GET /api/notebooks, POST /api/notebooks, GET /api/notebooks/:id, PATCH /api/notebooks/:id, DELETE /api/notebooks/:id
- Sections endpoints (protected): GET /api/notebooks/:id/sections, POST /api/sections, PATCH /api/sections/:id, DELETE /api/sections/:id
- AI generation endpoint (protected): POST /api/ai/generate with prompt and context support
- All protected routes use isAuthenticated middleware and validate user ownership
- Request validation using Zod schemas with drizzle-zod integration

**Data Models:**
- **Users:** id, username (unique), password (hashed), email, firstName, lastName, profileImageUrl, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Sessions:** sid, sess (jsonb), expire (for PostgreSQL session storage)
- **Notebooks:** id, userId (foreign key with cascade delete), title, emoji, documentType, aiMemory (jsonb for storing TODO/plan), createdAt, updatedAt
- **Sections:** id, notebookId (foreign key with cascade delete), title, content, orderIndex (text field for ordering)
- **Section Versions:** id, sectionId (foreign key with cascade delete), content, createdAt (automatic version snapshots)
- Schema-first approach with Drizzle ORM and automatic type inference
- insertNotebookSchema omits id, userId, createdAt, updatedAt (userId added by server from auth)
- Password field is omitted from all API responses for security

**Development Approach:**
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistent storage
- Standalone authentication with passport-local strategy
- Secure password hashing using scrypt
- PostgreSQL session storage using connect-pg-simple
- Hot module replacement in development via Vite middleware integration
- Custom logging middleware for API request tracking
- Error handling middleware for consistent error responses
- User ownership validation on all protected routes
