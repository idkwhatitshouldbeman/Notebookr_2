# Notebookr - AI-Powered Engineering Notebooks

## Overview
Notebookr is a free, AI-powered engineering notebook application designed to help engineers write technical documentation through a conversational interface. Users interact with an AI to generate all notebook content. The application features a standalone authentication system and utilizes free OpenRouter AI models with OpenAI as a fallback for content generation. Its ambition is to streamline technical writing, making it accessible and efficient for engineers.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (October 24, 2025)
- **Smarter Question Logic (3/4 Rule):** Changed from requiring ALL 4 checkpoints to requiring AT LEAST 3 of 4 (FORMAT, LENGTH, SCOPE, AUDIENCE). Expanded keyword recognition - now "10 page paper on cats for AP" proceeds without questions.
- **Meaningful Chapter Names:** Added strict section naming rules forbidding generic titles like "Body", "Introduction", "Chapter 1". AI now generates descriptive names like "Adorable Physical Features", "Endearing Feline Behaviors".
- **Multiple Paragraphs Per Chapter:** Each chapter now contains 2-5 paragraphs minimum with proper separation (\n\n). Creates more natural, book-like content instead of single paragraphs.
- **Original Instruction Display:** Added `originalInstruction` to plan variables for UI display of user's request.
- **Simplified Signup:** Removed confusing optional email/firstName/lastName fields. Now just username + password for cleaner UX.
- **Friendly Working Message:** Beautiful gradient banner with Sparkles icon showing "Feel free to step away - I'll keep working in the background" with elapsed time badge.
- **Schema Fix:** Updated `insertUserSchema` with `.optional().nullable()` for profile fields (email, firstName, lastName, profileImageUrl) to properly handle NULL database values and prevent registration failures.

## Previous Changes (October 23, 2025)
- **Aggressive Clarifying Questions System:** Planning uses 4 pattern-matching checkpoints to decide whether to ask clarifying questions.
- **Safety Guards for Missing Tasks:** Added null checks for `plan.tasks` array with fallback task generation.
- **Enhanced Question Handling:** Default questions provided if AI fails to generate questions.
- **Improved Awaiting Answers:** Explicit prompt for AI to generate `requiredSections` and `tasks` arrays.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logs throughout planning process.

## Previous Changes (October 20, 2025)
- **Green Completion Messages:** Section completion messages now show as "‚úÖ Finished making: [Section]" with expandable content. Messages persist in database and load on page reload. Chat only shows summary - actual content visible via click to expand.
- **Fixed Chapter Counter:** Shows completed chapters/total (e.g., 8/12) instead of task progress. Counts chapters with >500 chars as complete.
- **Colored Status Indicators:** Each chapter displays status dot: üî¥ red (<100 chars), üü° yellow (100-500 chars), üü¢ green (>500 chars).
- **Removed Iteration Limit:** AI runs indefinitely until marking work complete, with early exit when all sections are green (>500 chars).
- **Responsive Chapter Panel:** Expands on larger screens: base 320px (w-80), lg 384px, xl 448px, 2xl 512px.
- **Specific Task Messages:** Shows "‚úçÔ∏è Writing [Section]... (X/Y completed)" instead of generic "Executing tasks...".
- **Detailed Timing Logs:** Each API request duration displayed in chat (e.g., "‚è±Ô∏è API request completed in 5.23s") and persisted to database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Design System:** Custom color palette (warm beige/dark), Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, comprehensive component library, theme switching, and responsive design.
- **Key Features:** Standalone username/password authentication, chat-based AI content generation, conversational AI context understanding, notebook management (create, rename, delete, emoji support), chapters navigation, template system for document types, real-time content updates, and secure user-scoped data access.
- **UI/UX Decisions:** Full-screen document view, real-time chat progress updates (planning, executing, reviewing, post-processing phases), visual feedback for section updates (flashing animation), dynamic variables accordion, smart progress indicators, live section completion updates, and enhanced visual separation in expanded view.

### Backend Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), connect-pg-simple for session management, and OpenAI API integration.
- **API Design:** RESTful API, secure authentication endpoints (register, login, logout), protected notebook and section endpoints, AI generation endpoint, Zod for request validation, and user ownership validation.
- **Data Models:** PostgreSQL database storing Users, Sessions, Notebooks (including `aiMemory` for AI context), Sections, Section Versions (for history), and Messages (chat history with role and content). All sensitive data, like password hashes, are sanitized from API responses.
- **Development Approach:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, standalone authentication with scrypt hashing, PostgreSQL session storage, hot module replacement, custom logging, and error handling middleware.

### AI System
- **Four-Phase AI Workflow:** Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Post-Process.
    - **Planning:** Uses 4-checkpoint pattern matching (FORMAT, LENGTH, SCOPE, AUDIENCE) to evaluate user instructions. If AT LEAST 3 of 4 checkpoints present ‚Üí proceed to execution. If fewer than 3 ‚Üí ask clarifying questions. Expanded keyword recognition includes "paper/essay/report" (FORMAT), "10 page/5 pages" (LENGTH), "on cats/about dogs" (SCOPE), "AP/college/high school" (AUDIENCE). Extracts variables (topic, length, tone, criteria) and creates document plan with meaningful section names and tasks.
    - **Execution:** Processes one task per call, generating/updating sections with 2-5 paragraphs minimum. Each chapter has descriptive names (not "Body" or "Introduction"). Safety guards ensure tasks array always exists, with fallback generation from requiredSections.
    - **Review:** Evaluates content quality and completeness.
    - **Post-Process:** Transparently checks and fixes content to avoid AI detection patterns, enhancing human-like qualities.
- **AI Memory System:** `notebook.aiMemory` stores TODO lists, document plans, and original user instructions for persistent context.
- **AI Detection Avoidance:** Post-processing phase specifically targets and mitigates AI detection patterns.
- **Version History:** Automatic snapshots of sections before updates with restore functionality.
- **Question Handling:** Default questions provided if AI fails to generate questions. Awaiting answers phase regenerates full plan with tasks and sections.
